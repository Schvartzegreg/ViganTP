    <h1>FAMOUS PLACES IN VIGAN YOU CAN VISIT</h1>
    <h4>CALLE CRISOLOGO</h4>
    <p>
      Calle Crisologo is a street of old Spanish structures, mostly houses of
      wealthy families and Filipino-Chinese traders. This is where you’ll see
      the famous cobblestone streets that represent Vigan’s image.
    </p>
    <h4>BANTAY BELLTOWER</h4>
    <p>
      It has looked over the town of both Bantay and Vigan for centuries, and
      was known as Diego and Gabriela Silang’s favorite date spot during the
      17th century. The bell tower is situated on a hill, making it the best
      vantage point for those who were assigned to watch over the towns of Vigan
      and Bantay.

    <h4>VIGAN PLAZA/CATHEDRAL</h4>
    <p>
      The Vigan Cathedral has been a center of Roman Catholic devotion for
      centuries. The church as it stands now was completed in 1800. The original
      structure was built in 1574 upon the command of the Spanish founder of
      Vigan, Juan de Salcedo.

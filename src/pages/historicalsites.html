        <h4>CALLE CRISOLOGO</h4>
        <p>
          Calle Crisologo is a street of old Spanish structures, mostly houses
          of wealthy families and Filipino-Chinese traders. This is where you’ll
          see the famous cobblestone streets that represent Vigan’s image.

        <h4>BANTAY BELLTOWER</h4>
        <p>
          It has looked over the town of both Bantay and Vigan for centuries,
          and was known as Diego and Gabriela Silang’s favorite date spot during
          the 17th century. The bell tower is situated on a hill, making it the
          best vantage point for those who were assigned to watch over the towns
          of Vigan and Bantay.

        <h4>VIGAN PLAZA/CATHEDRAL</h4>
        <p>
          The Vigan Cathedral has been a center of Roman Catholic devotion for
          centuries. The church as it stands now was completed in 1800. The
          original structure was built in 1574 upon the command of the Spanish
          founder of Vigan, Juan de Salcedo.

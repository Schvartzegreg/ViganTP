          Vigan City was founded as a Spanish colonial settlement by Juan de
          Salcedo and Fr. Alonzo de Alvarado, OSA. It was was an important
          coastal trading post in pre-colonial times. Long before the Spanish
          galleons came, Chinese junks sailed from the South China Sea to Isla
          de Bigan through the Mestizo River. Sea-faring merchants came to
          barter exotic goods from Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax
          and other mountain products from the Cordilleras. Immigrants, mostly
          Chinese, settled in Vigan, intermarried with the natives and started
          the multi-cultural bloodline of the Bigueños. <br />
          As a reward for his services to the King, Salcedo was awarded the old
          province of Ylocos which then composed of the Ilocos Norte, Ilocos
          Sur, Abra, La Union and some parts of the Mountain Province as his
          Encomienda and was accorded the title as Justicia Mayor de esta
          Provincia de Ylocos.
        </p>
        <p class="history_par">
          It was believed that when Juan de Salcedo asked a native what the name
          of the place is, (as Salcedo spoke in Spanish), the native could not
          understand a word he was saying. Salcedo however was pointing on the
          ground and the native thought that he was actually asking for the name
          of the vegetation planted on the ground. He thereupon said “bigaa apo,
          bigaa apo”, referring to a tuber plant from the “gabi” or taro family.
          From then on the Spaniards named the place Bigan.

          The Silang Revolt: Diego and Gabriela, Ilocano couple freedom
          fighters.

        <p>
          Diego Silang’s aim was the creation of an Ilocano nation. This vision
          began when he personally witnessed the many abuses of the Spanish
          government and the Roman Catholic Church not only in Ilocos but
          wherever he traveled as courier for Vigan’s parish priest, delivering
          letters and documents to Manila and back. Having failed in
          negotiations with the Spanish authorities to establish a government in
          Ilocos with Ilocano functionaries, Diego Silang worked with the
          British forces to defeat the Spanish in the North. He already had
          control of Vigan in December of 1762. He was promised military
          assistance by the British to strengthen his hold and complete his
          plan, which unfortunately never came. Diego Silang was later killed by
          Miguel Vicos, a friend who was a mestizo (mix blood of Spanish and
          Ilocano). Vicos carried out his assassination of Diego during his
          visit to the latter’s house, accompanied by another of Diego’s friend
          Pedro Becbec. The traitorous act was of course instigated by the
          Spanish church and government authorities. Diego’s cause did not die
          with him, however. <br />
          His wife, Maria Josefa Gabriela Silang, continued his leadership. Her
          valiant efforts were overpowered by massive forces set upon her,
          forcing her retreat to Abra. She tried to lead her army back to Vigan
          but was again repelled. She was captured and put to death publicly by
          hanging in September 1763. Almost a hundred of her followers were also
          publicly hanged to serve as a warning to the Ilocanos. She is now
          remembered in Philippine history as the country’s Joan of Arc and
          first female leader for Filipino liberation. Her furious ride towards
          Vigan is immortalized in many statues all over the country erected in
          memory of her courage and sacrifice. She rejoined her husband only
          four months after his death.

        <h4>The Tinio Brigade in Vigan led by Major Estanislao Reyes</h4>
        <p>
          Gen. Tinio's vanguard marched to San Fernando and found the town
          besieged by revolutionaries from Zambales under "General" Mauro Ortiz.
          In a combined effort, Tinio and Ortiz finally forced the surrender of
          the Spaniards. Tinio resumed his march to the north and helped to
          liberate the towns of Balaoan, Bangar, and Tagudin. He proceeded to
          Candon where he met Isabelo Abaya, who had just liberated the town.
          Abaya was commissioned by Tinio as Captain of Infantry in the Tinio
          Brigade. Tinio and his force went farther north and entered the city
          of Vigan on August 13. He found the city already under control by Blas
          Villamor and Estanislao Reyes.
          <br />
          The Ilocano forces grew to a full brigade of more than 3,000
          fully-equipped and combat-ready troops. This regional army was
          formally integrated as an armed unit of the republic on the occasion
          of Gen. Tinio's appointment as military governor of the Ilocos
          provinces and commanding general of all Filipino forces in Northern
          Luzon.

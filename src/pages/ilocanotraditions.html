        <h4>VIGAN DIALECT</h4>
        <p>
          The dialect Vigan residences are using is the dialect of the whole
          ilocos region called the "Ilocano" Dialect. The Ilocano or also known
          as ilokano and Iloko, is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of
          the Austronesian language family. Ilocano is the third largest spoken
          language in the Philippines after Tagalog and English. The name
          Ilocano actually come from ‘I’meaning ‘from’, ‘looc’meaning ‘bay’ and
          ‘ano’ meaning ‘native of,’ thus ilocano means ‘people of the bay’.

        <img src="/src/cultureimages/atang.jpg" />
        <p>
          An atang is a traditional food offering for the Ilocanos to ward off
          evil spirits. The most common atang to ward off sickness is a rice
          cake or ofen called sinukat or sinuman for Ilocanos. Atang may also be
          a harvest offering. And usually Atang for Ilocanos are offered for
          their relatives who passed away, in order to comemorate and show that
          they are still important and are still in our heart even if they are
          already gone.

        <img src="/src/cultureimages/ag-gulgul.jpg" />
        <p>
          This ilocano tradition is usually done after the burial of the member
          of the family where in they wash thier head and usually done in the
          sea or river. It is said that this is done in order for the family
          members to wash away the pain of losing someone. And to wash away the
          sickness and bad luck assosiated with the death of the family member.

        <h4>The Ilocano Superstitions</h4>
        <p>
          When someone goes to a place that they're not used to go they say
          "dayu-dayu, bari-bari". Dayu actually mean go away, Bari is rooted
          from the Ilocano word bakir which means a greepy or far place.
          Ilocanos say Dayu-dayu, bari-bari to sent out spirits that might harm
          them while they are in their way going to the place they’re not used
          to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when they are on their way going home from a greepy or far place.
          Ilocanos are saying "Agawidun (your name), di ka agbatbati (your
          name)" because they believe that when you don’t say this word while
          going home your souls might left behind. They are telling their souls
          to come with them. Agawidun actually mean go home, and di ka agbatbati
          means don’t stay there or you come with me.

      <img src="/src/cultureimages/longganisa.jpg" />
      <p>
        Vigan longganisa is said to be an influence of the Mexican salami. The
        tradition of making this native has existed since the period of the
        Spanish galleon trade. For nearly a decade, Vigan has also hosted
        longganisa festivals every January which are attended by thousands of
        local and foreign visitors. They celebrate the festival with street
        dancing and other activities that have Vigan longganisa theme. They also
        choose the festival for launching of projects that help market the
        native Vigan sausage not only in the Philippines, but abroad as well.
        One of these projects is the financial assistance the local government
        has given in improving the packaging of the products of Vigan longganisa
        manufacturers.

      <h4>RANIAG (TWILIGHT) FESTIVAL</h4>
      <img src="/src/cultureimages/raniag.jpg" />
      <p>
        This twilight festival usually starts with the candle floaters along the
        Mestizo River signifying the cleansing of the community from bad luck
        and negative vibrations. It is also our mode of thanking God for the
        bounties from rivers and the sea. Coinciding with the Halloween Season,
        the glamorous float parade is not covered by fear and a trembling effect
        of paranoia but it is full of colorful lights and celebration. It
        highlights creativity of the Bigueños.
        <br /><br />
        Hundreds of sky lanterns are released on air every year during the Vigan
        Twilight Festival. Vigan's vibrant culture continues to build a strong
        foundation of identity that defines the spirit and soul of every
        Bigueño.
